These packages were moved from the svn repo M2-dev/mike/integral-closure-packages on 18 April 2018
    to the M2 repo 2018-mike-packages
and placed into a new directory M2/Macaulay2/mike-packages-in-progess
The plan is to clean up these packages, possibly removing some of these files/packages, and add them to M2.    


Here is the general plan:

Part A.
  Basic arithmetic in tower rings, both over a finite field and over QQ
  gcd's, division, univariate factorization over these rings.
  multivariate factorization over these rings (less important for now?)

  this includes packages:
    AdjoinRoots
    UPolynomials
    (UPolynomials2?)
    ModularGCD
    TowerRings
    
Part B. Puiseux and algorithms on (mostly plane) curves
  Puiseux
  IntegralBases
  LocalBasis
  TraceForm
  Trager
  MatrixNormalForms?
  
Part C. Integral closures
  FractionalIdeals (uses TraceForm)

      
Status of the various packages (14 May 2020, "at" Cleveland M2 workshop)
  TowerRings:
    install: ok (but no doc nodes)
    checks:
      3 tests fail.  2 seem to have worked when I tried this last.
    completeness of doc:
      no doc nodes at all
    what is missing?
      not sure yet.  Needs more extensive testing.
    missing in engine (comment from earlier, probably still relevant).
      if A --> B has lift, promote defined, then
        lift and promote should work for A[M] --> B[M]  
    
  TraceForm:
    install: ok
    checks: 1 test fails
    completeness of doc:
      there are 4 doc nodes written
    what is missing?
    
  FractionalIdeals: needs TraceForm
    14 May 2020: loads, no doc, one test fails.
    install: ok (but no doc nodes)
    checks: 1 test fails
    completeness of doc: none!
    what is missing?

  AdjoinRoots: 
    install: yes 
    checks: 3 errors
    completeness of doc: 2 doc nodes?
    what is missing?

  UPolynomials: AdjoinRoots
    install: ok
    checks: 1 error
    completeness of doc: only 2 doc nodes?
    what is missing?

    install: OK
    checks: OK
    completeness of doc: lots missing
    missing?
      really want factorization over a tower of fields, but this function doesn't provide that.
      in fact, when does the factorization function actually work?
    problems:
      adjoinRoots is here, but the package above should be used.

  Puiseux: UPolynomials
    install: 1 error
    checks: 3 tests fail
    completeness of doc:
    what is missing?

    Uses UPolynomials.  Why?  Hopefully we can avoid this?  It needs adjoinRoots, factorization (I think).
    3 tests fail: two seem just wrong, one seems like a real issue.
      but the tests are not so good anyway.
    1 example fails.  I might have the example wrong?  In any case there are too many 
    this package has an inscrutable interface!  Needs to be improved.

  MatrixNormalForms: nothing?
    install: ok (and 4 doc nodes)
    checks: no errors (and a number of tests, it seems)
    completeness of doc: ??
    what is missing? ??
    
  IntegralBases: UPolynomials, FractionalIdeals, Puiseux, MatrixNormalForms
    install: ok (but no doc!)
    checks: no tests!
    completeness of doc: no doc!
    what is missing?

  LocalBasis: UPolynomials, TowerRings, FractionalIdeals
    install: 3 example failures
    checks: lots of tests, 28 failures though!
    completeness of doc:
    what is missing?
      switchCenter: need to use one from adjoinRoots.
            
  ModularGCD: note says do not use.  It has been moved elsewhere.

  Trager: just code, not a package. (also trager-test)
  Valuations: just code, not a package.

  UPolynomials2: what is this, is it to be used?
  
    
      
Question:
  Given a tower ring which is a field, find a univariate extension giving the same ring.
  Problem here: working over tower rings is (almost certainly) much better, but maybe we should
    get a version working in the univariate case first.
