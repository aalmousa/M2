These packages were moved from the svn repo M2-dev/mike/integral-closure-packages on 18 April 2018
    to the M2 repo 2018-mike-packages
and placed into a new directory M2/Macaulay2/mike-packages-in-progess
The plan is to clean up these packages, possibly removing some of these files/packages, and add them to M2.    


Here is the general plan:

Part A.
  Basic arithmetic in tower rings, both over a finite field and over QQ
  gcd's, division, univariate factorization over these rings.
  multivariate factorization over these rings (less important for now?)

  this includes packages:
    AdjoinRoots
    UPolynomials
    (UPolynomials2?)
    ModularGCD
    TowerRings
    
Part B. Puiseux and algorithms on (mostly plane) curves
  Puiseux
  IntegralBases
  LocalBasis
  TraceForm
  Trager
  MatrixNormalForms?
  
Part C. Integral closures
  FractionalIdeals
  
Status of the various packages:
  AdjoinRoots: 
    install: OK
    checks: OK
    completeness of doc:
      missing: main package node is weak
    what is missing?
      not sure yet.  Needs more extensive testing.
    missing in engine:
      if A --> B has lift, promote defined, then
        lift and promote should work for A[M] --> B[M]  

  UPolynomials
    install: OK
    checks: OK
    completeness of doc: lots missing
    missing?
      really want factorization over a tower of fields, but this function doesn't provide that.
      in fact, when does the factorization function actually work?
    problems:
      adjoinRoots is here, but the package above should be used.

  Puiseux
    Uses UPolynomials.  Why?  Hopefully we can avoid this?  It needs adjoinRoots, factorization (I think).
    3 tests fail: two seem just wrong, one seems like a real issue.
      but the tests are not so good anyway.
    1 example fails.  I might have the example wrong?  In any case there are too many 
    this package has an inscrutable interface!  Needs to be improved.
  
  UPolynomials2 ??
  
  ModularGCD: note says do not use.  It has been moved elsewhere.
  
  TowerRings: no doc, one test fails.
      
Question:
  Given a tower ring which is a field, find a univariate extension giving the same ring.
  Problem here: working over tower rings is (almost certainly) much better, but maybe we should
    get a version working in the univariate case first.
